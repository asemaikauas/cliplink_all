# Audio Extraction & Speech Synchronization Fix

## 🎵 Problem Solved

**Issue**: `"no audio track found in file"` error when uploading video files to `/subtitles` endpoint.

**Root Cause**: The system was sending video files directly to Groq's transcription API, but Groq expects audio files.

**Solution**: Added automatic audio extraction from video files before transcription.

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. **Audio Extraction Pipeline**
- Automatically extracts audio from video files using `pydub`
- Converts to optimal format for Groq: 16kHz, mono, WAV
- Handles all common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
- Cleans up temporary audio files after transcription

### 2. **Speech Synchronization**
- Uses Groq's word-level timestamps for true speech sync
- Creates subtitles that appear exactly when words are spoken
- Fixes timing overlaps with 50ms gaps between subtitles
- Adds intelligent text wrapping for long content

### 3. **Robust Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback if audio extraction fails
- Clear error messages for videos without audio tracks
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage (Fixed)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/subtitles" \
  -F "video_file=@your_video.mp4" \
  -F "burn_in=true"
```

### With Speech Synchronization (New!)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/subtitles" \
  -F "video_file=@your_video.mp4" \
  -F "speech_sync=true" \
  -F "burn_in=true"
```

### All Parameters
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/subtitles" \
  -F "video_file=@your_video.mp4" \
  -F "burn_in=true" \
  -F "font_size=16" \
  -F "export_codec=h264" \
  -F "disable_vad=true" \
  -F "speech_sync=true"
```

## 🎯 New Features

### Speech Synchronization Mode
When `speech_sync=true`:
- Uses actual word timing from Groq's transcription
- Creates 3-6 word chunks based on natural speech patterns
- Breaks at punctuation and speech pauses
- No overlapping subtitles
- Perfect timing accuracy

### Subtitle Modes Available

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Traditional** | Long sentences, even distribution | Standard videos |
| **CapCut** | 3-6 word adaptive chunks | Social media content |
| **Speech-Sync** | True word-level timing | Professional/precise content |

## 🔧 Environment Variables

```bash
# Subtitle processing
SUBTITLE_MAX_CHARS_PER_LINE=50
SUBTITLE_MAX_LINES=2
SUBTITLE_MERGE_GAP_MS=200

# CapCut/Speech-sync parameters
CAPCUT_MIN_WORD_DURATION_MS=800
CAPCUT_MAX_WORD_DURATION_MS=1500
CAPCUT_WORD_OVERLAP_MS=150

# Enable modes
SUBTITLE_CAPCUT_MODE=true
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
cd backend
python test_audio_extraction.py
```

Expected output:
- ✅ Audio extraction successful
- ✅ Transcription with extracted audio works
- ✅ No "no audio track found" errors

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Error)
```
ERROR: Transcription failed: Error code: 400 - 
{'error': {'message': 'no audio track found in file'}}
```

### After (Success)
```
🎵 Extracting audio from video for transcription...
✅ Audio extracted successfully: 45.2s, 2.1MB
🎤 Starting transcription with Groq Whisper large-v3...
✅ Transcription complete: 23 segments, language: en
🎬 Subtitle mode: Speech-synchronized style
🎯 Using 156 word timestamps for speech sync
✅ Created 18 speech-synchronized chunks
✅ Fixed timing overlaps for 18 segments
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Audio Extraction Process
1. `pydub` loads video file and extracts audio track
2. Audio converted to 16kHz, mono, WAV format
3. Temporary audio file created with unique name
4. Groq transcription called with audio file
5. Audio file cleaned up after transcription

### Speech Sync Algorithm
1. Receive word-level timestamps from Groq
2. Group words into natural chunks (3-6 words)
3. Break at punctuation, pauses, and readability limits
4. Fix timing overlaps with sequential timing
5. Add text wrapping for long content

### File Processing Pipeline
```
Video File → Audio Extraction → Groq Transcription → 
Word Timestamps → Speech Sync Chunks → Subtitle Files → 
Burned Video (optional)
```
